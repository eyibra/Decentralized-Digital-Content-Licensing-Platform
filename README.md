# Decentralized Digital Content Licensing Platform

A blockchain-based ecosystem that revolutionizes digital content licensing through transparent rights management, automated tracking, and fair compensation for creators.

## Overview

The Decentralized Digital Content Licensing Platform transforms how digital content is licensed, tracked, and monetized across the internet. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform creates a transparent and efficient marketplace where creators maintain control over their work while enabling seamless distribution and fair compensation based on actual usage.

## Core Smart Contracts

The platform consists of four integrated smart contracts:

1. **Creator Verification Contract**: Validates ownership and establishes provenance of original content
2. **License Terms Contract**: Defines and enforces customizable usage rights for different purposes
3. **Usage Tracking Contract**: Monitors content utilization across various platforms and channels
4. **Royalty Distribution Contract**: Automates payments to rights holders based on verified usage

## Key Features

- **Immutable Ownership Records**: Tamper-proof verification of content creation and ownership
- **Customizable License Templates**: Flexible terms for different usage scenarios (commercial, editorial, etc.)
- **Granular Usage Permissions**: Fine-grained control over how content can be used
- **Automated Rights Enforcement**: Smart contracts that enforce license compliance
- **Real-time Usage Tracking**: Transparent monitoring of content utilization
- **Instant Royalty Payments**: Automated micropayments based on actual usage
- **Multi-contributor Support**: Fair distribution to all contributors (co-creators, featured subjects, etc.)
- **Derivative Works Management**: Tracking and compensation for content adaptations
- **Global Rights Registry**: Searchable database of licensable content
